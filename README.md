It is a front-end application developed for WalkYourPlace, which is a framework for assessment of accessibility to urban facilities using quality of life indicators, such as the number of grocery stores, shopping and recreation facilities, and local crime. The system evaluates in real time an area that is accessible using pedestrian, transit, and cycling infrastructure.
